# MakeChangeProject

<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Jacob Stuart</h1>
<h3 align="center">Programming student with Skill Distillery</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [MakeChangeProject](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge/MakeChangeProject)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Java**

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/VulcanMindForge](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge)

<h3 align="left">Purpose of this project:</h3>
 <p align="left"> Calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. Notify the attendant how many of each type of currency ($100, $20, $10, $5, $1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer.</p>

<h3 align="Left">Technologies used:</h3>
<p align="left">Overall I am learning and using Eclipse IDE to program in Java 1.8. Prior to this assignment we covered: Variables and Constants, Methods, Screen Output and Keyboard Input, Expressions, If/Else, Switch, While loops, For Loops, Cast Numerals. I plan to implement as many of these systems as make sense to get a better grasp of their uses and best practices.</p>

<h3 align="Left">Current progress:</h3>
<p align="left">
	<ol> 
		<li>Created method to do the change logic: If/Else, Expressions, Cast Numerals</li>
		<li>Declared variables and tested method call: Methods, Variables and constants</li>
		<li>Initiated scanner and got input from user: Screen output and Keyboard input</li>
	</ol>
</p> 

<h3 align="Left">Next Step:</h3>
<p align="left"> 
	<ol> 
		<li>Write out logic to discard denominations that are not needed: for loop</li>
		<li>Create transaction menu and finish methods: switch</li>
		<li>Create loop to keep performing transactions until finished: while loops</li>
	</ol>
</p>
